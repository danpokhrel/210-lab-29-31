1. The alignment of the output from displayData is off
    s. On line 182, move setw(4) to be before plants and add left the the beginning of the cout
2. The dashes at the start and end of displayData does not cover the contents
    s. Double the number of dashes in the cout
3. Having lots of 0s in displayData makes it hard to read
    s. Write code to display "0" as "_"
4. No reproduction was happening
    s. It was because REPRODUCE_RATE was a float so I changed it to int
5. Populations were dying out too quickly
    s. Change moving part of simulation to have organism move to the cell with the most food
6. Two organisms in a list with the same age and hunger could both get deleted in the move portion of the simulation
    s. Replace remove() with erase() and an iterator to one specific element
7. Animals that move to other cells die out because most cells don't have any plants
    s. Make plant reproduction independent of cell of parent
8. Animals are still dying out too quickly
    s. Unsolved, nothing I tried fixed the problem
9. Looping through organisms sometimes causes a read access violation
    s. Store orgs we want to delete in a new vector and delete them after the Loop
10. The output can't handle large numbers
    s. Increase margins
